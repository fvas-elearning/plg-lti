## How to get Student/Staff Number

What we could do is check that the LDAP plugin is installed and enabled,
if so then when the staff or student logs in for the first time prompt
them via dialog or similar to either log in using their uni password 
(not my preferred option but is automatic) 

Orr alternatively we could add the required data fields to the dialog 
and get the user to enter them manually like mobile number, student number, etc...

This dialog could be part of the system and pops up automatically when data is 
missing from a users account. It should be built as a stand alone module that 
plugins could access.
